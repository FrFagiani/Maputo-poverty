# Maputo poverty profiles

The project aim to identify the wealth level fro each morphological areas identified in greater Maputo area.
To define the class we consider some factros that strongly influence the poverty rate and that are the followings:
- access to drinking water at home
- adequate sanitation at home
- source of reliable energy
- access to information and communication technology
- having a permanent source of income or savings

Here some factors that influence poverty rate at the neighbourhood level:
- public transport stops distance
- health facilities distance
- school distance
- access to basi services (electricity, water, sanitation)
- durable houses (construction material)
- building density
- infrastructure density
- access to real estate market (affordable houses)

### Access to health facilities



### Access to water
In order to define the access to water we considered water point (AdeM) and water network. The only one report to provide spatial dimension for water (but not updated)
Waiting for detailed information and data (as in another Moz region)
